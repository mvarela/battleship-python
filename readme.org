* Battleship

** Requirements
   
   The requirements defined are as follows:
   
   - Implement a game of "Battleship" in Python
   - The play mode is a human player vs an "AI", which should be smarter than simply firing at random positions
   - The board should be a 10x10 grid
     - Note: this will be the default, but the API shall be more generic
   - Each player has 5 ships, of lengths 2, 3, 4 and 5 (with two instances of the ship of length 3)
     - Note: again, the API will allow for more generality, but the default will be this
   - Ships can be positioned either vertically or horizontally, and may not overlap
   - The game proceeds as a sequence of alternating rounds (first player is chosen randomly)
     - In each round, each player choses a (free) square in the grid to fire at, and is notified of whether the shot hit water, or an enemy's ship.
     - Once a ship has been hit in all its length, it is sunk.
   - The game ends when a player sinks all the oponent's ships.
     
     
** Data model
   - The core of the problem lies in representing the board's state, and its transitions.
     - The grid itself can be represented as an array of arrays (I guess list of
       lists in Python's parlance), and within each cell in the grid, we
       represent the known state, which can be one of the following:
       - Empty / water (there is no ship here). An empty cell can be revealed as water to the opponent once it's hit.
       - Ship. This cell corresponds to a ship. The ships themselves do not
         carry much state, but we can represent them as a =length=, and a set of
         hits, representing the cells which have been hit, if any. On the board
         itself, each ship cell could point to an actual =Ship= object
         containing this data.
         - For display purposes, and for the AI, we need to distinguish between
           damaged and non-damaged cells in the ship. This can be inferred from
           the set of hits in the ship's representation
     - A set of ships, for easy access to the ships' data (e.g, for determining whether all ships have been sunk)
     - The game itself consists of two boards, one for each player, and the
       current state of the AI (that is, the AI will need to remember what it
       was "currently doing / planning on doing" at the last turn.
         
         

*** Board
     
    Our board's main feature will be a grid in which we represent the state of
the game. We can have cells that are either empty, or part of a ship. In
addition, if the cell has been hit, we can distinguish between water, and a part
of a ship that's been hit. A simple dictionary would be sufficient to represent
this information, but in a more OO-friendly way we can implement a simple class
hierarchy for representing this data, which we can then exploit for rendering
the board by having each piece =draw= itself. 

#+begin_src jupyter-python :exports code :results silent :eval never :tangle "battleship/pieces.py"
  class Piece():
      def draw(this):
          return " "

  class EmptyPiece(Piece):
      def draw(this):
          return "E"

  class WaterPiece(Piece):
      def draw(this):
          return "W"

  class ShipPiece(Piece):
      def __init__(this, shipId, index):
          """

          """
          this.shipId = shipId
          this.index = index
      def draw(this):
          return "S"

  class HitShipPiece(ShipPiece):
      def draw(this):
          return "H"

Coming to our board

  # Our Board class:

  class Board:
    """Represents the core of our data model: a rectangular grid where we can
  position ships, fire upon them, and check the status of a grid cell that has
  been fired upon.

       grid = [[for y]]
